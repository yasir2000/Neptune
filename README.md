# Neptune Project

This work is a part of PhD reserch in autonomic cloud computing from since 2004.

Please follow publications attached to the work of enhancing Neptune Framework:

 The platform we worked on which is embraced by the code and miniature IDE, apart from the UI elements and framework used the architecture included the following:

- A software architecture of illuminating Autonomous Agent Oriented Software Engineering platform, following BDI and some other cognitive architecture c/c's like Actor Model and asynchronous constraint concurrent programming paradigm

- A language semantics which included new instructions, declarative approach of directives, objective based programming style, grammar rules, syntax, scope based lexicon and more

- Behavioral and structural models where added through defining rule based goal orientation to software autonomous agent, such as constraints, plans, facades, moods, actions, goals, intentions, concepts (fuzzy concepts), situations, fluents, subjects/aspects, problem descriptions, ....etc

- The language representation abstract followed clearly functional programming with monads, monolithic objects, futures-promises, lambdas, immunization, tuples, DSL's,  ...etc and all Lisp feature set via higher scripting of closure or Clojure architecture running over JVM  and CLR

- The architecture followed rigorously actor model of concurrency, java object team model, also aspect and dynamic aspect oriented modeling, it supported also dynamic metaprogramming, template metaprogramming, retrospective programming, ...etc 


- In addition to the above, our code architecture runs a fully workable AI automation supporting automated AI planning model, with Rete algorithm, temporal logic planning, state machine, graph search, it has a rule engine abstract, reasoning model for decision making, conflict resolution and trade-off's resolution, bottlenecks and race concurrency detection, MDP, deterministic and non-deterministic search and almost most if not all AI search methods and strategies.

- The architecture used libs and wrapped over API's linking other frameworks like Jacrim, Tropos, STRIP-PDDL description standards, TLPlan

- The dialect of the code and all scripting wrapper is CLisp, and the direction of the code was made to serve MVC model web app development using all the above features of architectural types and behaviors.

- Prior to this code a full running framework of integrating JBI service container (SOA messaging bus) was developed with Java  and was all designed to serve WS-BPEL SOA model of communicating and challenging SOA stack from higher business requirements abstract to physical. And to intelligently use the architecture above in design new business patterns from data messaging at runtime over BPEL execution engine, techniques used were metascripting and template metaprogramming with like meta classes/meta data to be intelligently injected (like dependency injection pattern for ex) to modify host architecture with new requirements semantically.

- As mentioned from above, the work covered broad range of functionalities and swayed over long course and milestones which took years of work.

Hence am in a position to start deploying new plan of proliferating the work publically, to serve the following tracks  :

- Track of code stability, usability, .....etc
- Track of keep change log, revisioning, versioning, releases...etc 
  
- Main expected release updates in the roadmap is continue working on the architecture interoperability model, by solving issues of API's, SOA integration with all SOA stack frameworks and standards including adapting semantic requirements from higher abstracts and judging them via the reasoning and automation inside same intention-goal of BDI agent architecture to achieve runtime code or code blocks generation (scripts).

- Most importantly the architecture philosophy roadmap which brought the term of [[Theosophic Computing]] to live. Here in this course, I want to randomize new challenges of  following [[Cognitive Architecture]] and more beyond the work of BenGoertzel to address new challenges of the [[God Divinity]] architecture or the [[Meaning of Life]] as God is the greatest architect of the universe. 

1- I want to publish latest code v 2.0 which was running before over the scripting IDE, which was a cloud based tool to build blocks of Agent Based Software Eng. and as I mentioned AI was the latest arm and mechanics for AI planning and AI search to commit agent transactions over MVC or route based architecture to build rapid applications on the cloud.


2- To also mention that another approach which went commercial from our prev colleagues is now running as intelligence support to enhance client side UI/UX over SAP HANA Fiori. The guys of talents from SAP collated with original code to build an AI platform on client side Fiori (they are based in Oslo)

3- I have been researching and further complementing another different direction which I have published by last paper on March 2013 [[Oblivion Clouds: Towards Self-Conscious Cloud Based Application Development]], the approach I was working on through almost 5 years now from 2012, and on is the efforts to go more deep into and maybe farther than Cognitive Architecture were many possibilities to investigate there, entouching Neptune's untouched areas in the area of Cognitive Computing.


4- My latest philosophy which was a novel approach to a whole computing paradigm called "Theosophic Computing" was to address these areas of paranormal theo based behavior of software architecture to accomplish [[autonomous agent tasks]], where phenomenons like bird's flocks, fish schols,....etc and even more are today a questionable area for many researchers like Rupert Sheldrake 1  trying to prove.

5- Its not like a moral fundamental framework to deal with software tasks as much as drawing and creating the architectural elements of a new computing paradigm which lineaments are these astonishing behaviors and c/c's in God like divinity world.

6- Such phenomenons were addressed by BenGeortzel and Hugo DeGaris

But did not dare literally to introduce what was going on in the realm of hidden intelligence.

7- So the art of "Theosophic Computing" was running too far beyond enhancing ethics and morale behind dealing with app development, as much as concertizing 1000 of phenomenons which are ruling our world and life from behind the wheels.


My first next task in the model is to publish the code done in proper way and collate over rolled artistic thoughts to manifest the project culminating many tactics of Neptune and maybe transforming the whole intelligence model of Neptune into more holistic learning modes which all roll over theological and mythological aspects of the behavioral and structural of software engineering whether application or utility or far broader manifestations like IoT, Cloud, Fog and other computing paradigms.

My aim is not to comprehend for new programming paradigm rather than enhancing both code semantics and architectural aspects to stimulate these un mastered phenomena's at some points in antiquity were attributed as cosmic or spiritual or more than that.

I much ever and for longtime (maybe two years) attempted to emphasize over a drop in an ocean in the world of philosophy as lsinked to cosmology, mysticism, theology, trinity, divine, occult and Gnostic   

And with 15 years of research in computing paradigms embracing all programming paradigms and desperately upheaval of knowing the succinct think silk of knowledge that may apprehend hidden knowledge with science, especially in symbolical math (math model)..

No one had proved this before, and yet no one dared to touch computational models that may alienate drama to cool breeze or sex to diaspora or morale to altruistic enthusiasm and more..


I design this heap of knowledge just to show how powers of spirituality in which metaphysical archetypal techniques, like Law of Attraction or theory of Cybernetics ( synergy or morphological etymology)  can be understood from a computational architecture approach.


Its believably hard and play of unwary to address such call..

Especially when machines do not obey nature rules of life, although they were brought to.

I brought up this world of mayhem into much more legitimized world of architectural structures of models i.e computational models.


Then I came up with the birth of the new era, a new computational paradigm of :

[[Theosophical Computing]]

May someone step his fist into the meaning and language (semantic ontology of the term), why and how.


Theosophic Computing is a calm place where next coming world of Singularity, Transhumanism finds a seat for Social Intelligence, Ambient Agents and Astrotypal  type of learning and cognition in mind using ""Deep Consciousness"" "where no place of subordinate levels of apprehension can deal with reality, like Oblivion for ex.

Theosophical Computing is subtle phenomenal amplification of unknown or unseen world of missing accusations, in-evident witnessing to less grasped truths and facts. Loose realization to enough liability of subconsciousness.


I had been working to place grounds to that field of computing and why its a filed of that domain of science.

Computing is still the pivotal arm that machinarize life and nature.


It still lack proofs of mythical aspects of this life.

((see hermetica and tools of divinity))

Theosophical Computing merely is judging mechanical etymology between : Computing - Mythology - Divine - Spirit Science - Sporadic Phenomenons of Micro metaphoric data - Demiurge God - Nature - Rendition - Divination - Reincarnation - Immortal creativity - Telepathy - Ritualism - Extraterrestrial Phenomenons - Engineered Spirituality - Anomalies - Mysticism - Theosophia - Primordial Divinity - Apocalyptic Armageddon Science - Pantheons of Gods - Astra Anatheism  - Occultism - Gnostic - Esoteric Science  and all these broad realms of physics into mathematically and computationally Cartesian blocks.

Its quite interesting to define behavioral and structural models of computations to undermine the above from theoretical and scientific view aspects.

And still this newly invented paradigm will gain more momentum to researchers and novelist in future technologies such as Cyborg and "Mandasim of Technology" to drive sincerity to this realm.

Keep in mind that Prof Plavatsky (Polish - American ) is the first who established the [[Theosophical Society]] at the new age movement.

I wanted to draw attention to a work been done in collaboration with my dearest futurist computer scientists and one of rare minds that I dearly admire in the world of programming paradigms [[ Peter Fisk ]]

He was the inventor of early stairs in SmallTalk - ALisp or Lisp family and in particularly Clojure ((ALisp family functional programming lang))

Peter had invented ((Express Rails Programming Language)) at 2013 and through long journey of architecting programming langs in modern way such like DSL and alike, he is of most enthusiasts I met in this realm of science, Peter is Canadian of over mid sixties and I guess more than a geek to follow theory of Singular minded.



I asked him to share thoughts of putting miniature sounds to the world of Theosophic Computing at Quora and he came up with :

https://www.quora.com/What-is-Theosophic-Computing/answer/Peter-Fisk-3?srid=MmrA


A. Defining Theosohpy

Gaining a direct knowledge of God is the utmost goal of Theosophy

There are more complete definitions but this seems to be the core of the philosophy.

B. Divinity and Science

Philosophical thinking in the modern age derives from the Enlightenment movement starting in the 18th century.

It is often believed that scientific progress will be able to explain all of the mysteries of the natural world.

C. Heisenberg and The Uncertainty Principle

With the development of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, it became apparent that we will never be able to fully understand the natural world regardless of how sophisticated our technology. Heisenbergs uncertainty principle limits the accuracy of any measurements that we can make. And the double slit experiment still baffles theorists. From experiments, we know that quantum theory is valid, but we certainly do not understand it.

D. Mathematical Mysteries

Eulers Identity relates five fundamental mathematical constants. Richard Feynman called in the the most remarkable formula in mathematics. All the constants were derived independently over the centuries. We have absolutely no idea of why they are related to one another by a simple formula.

E. Computational Mysteries

With the development of computers, mathematicians have been able to explore generated set of numbers. One of these generated sequences is known as the Mandelbrot set which when displayed graphically displays an infinite set of complex images starting from a very simple formula. Simple formulas will normally display simple patterns when plotted. There is no understanding of why Mandelbrot sets are so different - they should not exists but they do.

F. Wolframs New Kind of Science

Steven Wolfram published a book in 2002 called A New Kind of Science which explains the natural world in terms of computational algorithms rather than classical physics. The theory contains many insights but is very controversial.

G. Simulation Hypothesis

The simulation hypothesis proposes that reality is in fact a simulation. This could explain many mysteries including Eulers Identity, Mandelbrot Sets, and Quantum Mechanics.

There doesnt seem to be any definite reason why this would be impossible.

Summary

The universe that we inhabit is mysterious in ways that are beyond our comprehension. We must accept with humility that we will never fully understand it.

There are many paths in our attempt to understand the divine.

Religions have for centuries provided us with the essential guidance.

Science has expanded our horizons and well-being but has uncovered deeper mysteries at the same time.

Computers are tools which were invented in the 20th century and may lead us to totally unexpected discoveries - much as the invention of the telescope did in the 17th century.

We should follow every path that is available in the search for the ultimate truth of our existence.
